### Project title

Decider

### What and why?

What's for dinner tonight? Should I say yes to him? What should I review for the next class? We believe many of us have a hard time to make some decisions nowadays.
There is no best option, and there is no worst option! Then let us decide it randomly for the users!
To cope with choice difficulties, our website can help users to make a decisions quickly in order to save their time. In public places (such as classes or parties), it can also help us to choose people randomly.

### For whom?

Decider is mainly for the users who have a hard time making choices, or the users who have many equally important choices that are hard to choose.

### How?
Basically, users can:
1. Create decisions(users can add decision's weight).
2. During party games, lucky players can be chosen from a turntable. 
3. Generating random numbers in a specific interval. 
4. Users can choose and design from a variety of themes .
5. Share the decisions with friends via link or text. 
6. Quickly import options from the clipboard.
 
 **
Extented functions includes:
1. Coin toss: use heads and tails to help you make decisions.
2. Multiuser interactions: Share urls to others, and multiple usrs can add multiple decision items at the same time.

### Scope

This proposal basically requires implementations of random option decider, account data storage, multi-user real-time interaction. What's more, more mini-features could be added such as small games for party time, bill pay draw-lots, etc.

## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
