### Project title

Decider

### What and why?

What's for dinner tonight? Should I say yes to him? What to review first for the upcoming exam? Who's next to do the housework? <br>
We believe many of us have a hard time making some decisions nowadays.
There is no best option, and there is no worst option! Then let "decider" choose randomly for you!<br> 
Coping with the difficulties of making choices, "decider" can help users make quick decisions to save time. No hesitation, no overthought, let's obey the fate!<br>

### For whom?

Decider is mainly for the users who have a hard time making choices, or the users who have many equally important tasks and feels hard to arrange the priority. Users can add their choices or tasks, which will be arranged equally into a "lucky wheel".<br>
What's more, it's multifunctional in at any place, at any time -- the "lucky one" is always easily and fairly chosen. During class, it helps the teachers to select students randomly to answer the questions. During parties, it helps to pick people randomly or play truth or dare games.<br>

### How?

Users can:
1. Create a decisions list and add each decision's significant coefficient).
2. Choose lucky players from a "lucky wheel" during party games. 
3. Generate random numbers in a given interval. 
4. Choose and design from a variety of themes.
5. Save the decision history to the account for repetitive uses in the future.
6. Share their decisions outcome with friends via link or text. 
7. Import options in certain format directly from the clipboard.
 
**
Extended functions may include:
1. Coin toss: use heads and tails to help you make decisions.
2. Multiuser interactions: Share URLs to others, and multiple users can add multiple decision items to the list.

### Scope

This proposal requires the implementation of a random option decider, computer graphics, and account data storage. The multi-user interaction may be an extended feature to be implemented. More mini-features can be added such as small games for party time.

<!-- ## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team. -->
