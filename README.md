<!-- # Project Proposal

Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester. Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Collaboration

You are welcome to write a proposal with up to 5 other students, if desired. If you do work with others on the proposal, you **must** clearly indicate the names of all the team members in your proposal.

## What to include

Your proposal must focus on the product's value proposition, including answers to the questions below. Keep it thorough but concise. If you are not clear on whether your writing is any good, consult with a friend. -->

### Project title

Decider

### What and why?

What's for dinner tonight? Should I say yes to him? What should I review for the next class? We believe many of us have a hard time to make some decisions nowadays.
There is no best option, there is no worst option! Then let us decide it randomly for the user!
To cope with choice difficulties, our website can help users to make a decisions quickly to save their time. In public places (such as classes or parties), it can also help the user choose people randomly.

### For whom?

Decider is mainly for the users who have a hard time making choices, such as those who have a rich material and social life.

### How?
Basically, users can:
-Create decisions(users can add decisions' weight).
-During party games, players can be drwan from a turntable. 
-Generating random numbers in a specific interval. 
-Users can choose and design from a variety of themes .
-Share the decisions with friends via link or text. 
-Quickly import options from the clipboard.
 
 **
Extented functions includes:
-Coin toss: use heads and tails to help you make decisions.
-Multiuser interactions: Share urls to others, and multiple usrs can add multiple decision items at the same time.

### Scope

This proposal basically requires implementations of random option decider, account data storage, multi-user real-time interaction. What's more, more mini-features could be added such as small games for party time, bill pay draw-lots, etc.

## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
